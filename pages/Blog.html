        This table below will give you a brief idea of the taxi fares in and around Shillong:

Half Day: 1300 INR

How much will a 4-day trip to Shillong cost?
On average, a Shillong trip for 4 days (from Guwahati) will cost you around 8000-10000 INR.
I have given a breakdown of my costs above. Also, as I said, you can cut down on the costs if you travel in a group.
